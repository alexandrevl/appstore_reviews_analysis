# App Store Reviews Analysis

## Description
This project is a Jupyter notebook for the analysis of App Store reviews, intended primarily for educational purposes. It provides an example of how to connect to a MongoDB database, extract review data, and perform data analysis to understand user sentiment, identify common issues, and evaluate overall app performance.

## System Requirements and Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Libraries: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pymongo`

### Installation
To install the required Python libraries, run the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn numpy matplotlib pymongo
```

## How to Use
1. Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible.
2. Update the `uri` variable in the notebook with your MongoDB connection URI.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook cell-by-cell, observing the outputs and adjusting queries as needed for your specific dataset.

## Data
The dataset includes App Store reviews with fields such as review text, score, and date of submission. The data is retrieved from a MongoDB database using an aggregation pipeline defined within the notebook.

## Analysis Overview
The analysis includes:
- Keywords and category definition for review analysis.
- Data extraction from MongoDB with a defined timeframe.
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Visualization of trends and patterns in the reviews.
- Interpretation of user sentiment and identification of common issues.

## Educational Use
This project is designed for educational purposes, to demonstrate data analysis techniques in Python and MongoDB. It can be used as a learning tool for students, educators, or anyone interested in data science applications.
